sword-blocking:
  # This is to allow players to block with swords again, by getting a shield while they hold right click with a sword
  enabled: true
  # How often, in ticks, OCM should check if the player is still blocking with a shield, and remove it if not
  # If this is too fast the player will have their shield disappear before they're able to block again causing a slight delay
  # If this is too slow players will have a shield in their hand well after they've stopped blocking
  # 20 ticks = 1 second

shield-damage-reduction:
  # This module allows changing the damage reduction behaviour of shields
  enabled: true
  # How much damage blocking should reduce
  # This can either be a number in half-hearts (e.g 2) or a percentage (e.g. 20%)
  # 1.8 default: 50%             1.9 default: 33%
  # Before either is applied the plugin subtracts 1 as that is how it worked in 1.8
  generalDamageReduction: 50%
  # This value works the same but is exclusively for projectile damage
  projectileDamageReduction: 50%

  # Potion effects golden apples should apply
  # Duration is in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)

  enabled: true
  # How often, in seconds, a player should regenerate health
  frequency: 3
  # How many half-hearts the player should heal by, every seconds specified above
  amount: 1
  # How much exhaustion healing should give to the player. In 1.8: 3    In 1.9: 4    In 1.11: 6
